Said a spokesperson for the company, &amp;quot;We were wondering how to work in Tigra, whether she should join 'Inhumans' or make an appearance on 'Iron Fist'. Eventually we decided that she needed her own show and, well, it kinda snowballed from there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new lineup will include shows for Beetle, Dazzler, the Great Lakes Avengers, Molecule Man, four seperate versions of Hawkeye, Newnight with She-Hulk, Yellowjacket &amp;amp; Silverclaw, a cooking show judged by the Fantastic Four, Law &amp;amp; Order: Powers, Law &amp;amp; Order: Powers: Los Angeles, America's Next Avenger, a buddy comedy featuring Toad &amp;amp; High Evolutionary, X-Force, X-Corps, X-Statix, Survivor: Madripoor and an as yet untitled project where Jessica Jones regains her superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are shoutouts and references within each of the shows to each other,&amp;quot; said the spokesperson. &amp;quot;For example, if you watch 'Doctor Druid' closely, you'll see why Drax the Destroyer hates Neutron. And how Joystick first met Major Mapleleaf. The shows will be building up to one big crossover event at the end of the season. So yeah, you're pretty much going to have to watch them all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20 hour end-of-season special will be co-directed by Edgar Reitz (&amp;quot;Heimat&amp;quot;) and Shane Carruth (&amp;quot;Primer&amp;quot;), featuring more than 2500 speaking parts and 13 different timelines. The labrythine plot is being managed by use of Google DeepMind and “a huge-ass corkboard”. Costs will be kept low by filming in, and employing, Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, the new lineup will consist of more than 7000 hours of television, more than a years worth of waking hours. When challenged on this, Marvel cited market research indicating that fans &amp;quot;didn't have much going on, anyway&amp;quot; and that they hoped for strategic alliances with food and wet-wipes delivery businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if Plastic Man would be appearing, the spokesperson replied &amp;quot;Eh, why not. He can team up with Squirrel Girl. Yeah, Squirrel Girl.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;People complain the old package management system doesn’t work and/or is too complex. A solution is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a strange and inappropriate common word for the name of your new system. It should have nothing to do with the actual function or workings of your tool. “Groundhog”? “Frigate …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People complain the old package management system doesn’t work and/or is too complex. A solution is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a strange and inappropriate common word for the name of your new system. It should have nothing to do with the actual function or workings of your tool. “Groundhog”? “Frigate”? “Fairy”? Not only will users find this cute, but it will make it impossible to google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work out a catchy tagline for the product. “Never do the same thing twice with Groundhog!” “Fairy makes installing software magic!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the various entities your product handles something appropriate to the tool name. “Fairy downloads software in packages it calls ‘toadstools’ that it installs in a root level cache '.magickingdom'. Troubleshoot your fairy config file with the ‘pixie' tool.” Sure, it may just be a jar or zip file but call it a 'toadstool'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, there’s XML in there somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because your new tool is too simple / too complex / doesn’t use enough XML, someone will write an alternative tool that interoperates with your repo and data. They will give it a apropos name like “Gnome” or “Leprechaun”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch a variant data format that makes up for the inadequacies of the previous one, probably packaging binaries. Call it something whimsical like ‘mushroom’ or ‘fungal infection’. Of course, you’ll need special tools to create and manage these packages. XML will be involved somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People complain the old package management system doesn’t work and/or is too complex ...&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, a lot of HR systems, admin forms and clinical software have web front ends that are generated or driven by Oracle Forms or other Oracle tech.  And, for reasons that are completely opaque, these web forms will frequently misbehave or refuse to run in …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="the-problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, a lot of HR systems, admin forms and clinical software have web front ends that are generated or driven by Oracle Forms or other Oracle tech.  And, for reasons that are completely opaque, these web forms will frequently misbehave or refuse to run in any browser that isn’t Internet Explorer running on a Windows machine (sometimes complaining of a “registry.dat” failure). You’re on a Mac - what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="disguise-your-browser"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disguise your browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lines with what is written here (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://attiqahmed.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/running-oracle-application-on-google-chrome-2/"&gt;http://attiqahmed.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/running-oracle-application-on-google-chrome-2/&lt;/a&gt;), install a Spoofer, a Chrome extension that will be able to manipulate the web traffic that identifies your browser. Then add the given custom domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, the instructions are slightly outdated - you do not have to clear the browser history or restart it. Also, the custom domain is added to the “Permanent spoof list”. Another solution is the same (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://community.oracle.com/message/9786080"&gt;https://community.oracle.com/message/9786080&lt;/a&gt;) but doesn’t use the custom domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; I had a bit of peculiar behaviour but this seems to mostly work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-firefox"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; This was reported to work but while the forms would load, there was some strange behaviour when interacting with the forms. It may have been something to do with my machine and/or installation of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="run-ie-in-a-virtual-machine"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run IE in a virtual machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s a pain, but this will work and you could potentially run any OS/ browser combination. Depending on you local network setup, there may also be some proxy issues to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="install-a-different-chrome-extension"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Install a different Chrome extension&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an extension (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.oracleebstech.com/2013/06/how-to-use-google-chrome-with-ebs/"&gt;http://www.oracleebstech.com/2013/06/how-to-use-google-chrome-with-ebs/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/ptian/entry/how_to_use_chrome_to"&gt;https://blogs.oracle.com/ptian/entry/how_to_use_chrome_to&lt;/a&gt;) that supposedly lets you work with some recent Oracle versions. Success is apparently mixed. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://community.oracle.com/message/10613315"&gt;https://community.oracle.com/message/10613315&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; didn’t try but will if there are further problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="postcript"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Postcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some further issues with Chrome. Some of the Oracle web forms use Java and it is reported that in at least some cases the minimal Java version is beyond that supported by Chrome on OSX. I did not encounter this but caveat browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reluctance of Oracle to support Chrome is inexplicable - it has over 40% of the browser market, no matter how measured, by many metrics more than IE. Oracle cites “low demand” (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/plans_for_certifying_google_chrome"&gt;https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/plans_for_certifying_google_chrome&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pope Francis will be appointed official &amp;quot;Mate&amp;quot; of Australia, meaning that we will all be able to drop over to his place for a beer, to borrow jumper leads and ask his opinion on the renovation of the back porch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will save on defense and immigration control by playing up the dangerous nature of Australian wildlife, inventing several new and ferocious animals, e.g. the carno-dingo, the winged chameolo-croc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barbecues will be subsidized and the price of Tim-Tams will be strictly controlled for the purposes of preserving Australian &amp;quot;culture&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time, we'll do the Republic right.&lt;/li&gt;

It does a simple thing well: enable like-minded people to run a club or group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When joined, Meetup gets a list of your interests and later mails you if relevant groups setup near you. But, like almost all other recommendation engines, the results are curious ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The Black Entrepenurs Meetup&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Muslim Thinkers Meetup&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a strange selection, given the interests I've selected on my profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Programming - Data Visualization - Machine Learning - Data Science - Data Mining - Big Data - Board Games - Country Western Music - War Games - Rock Climbing - Alt-Country - Wargaming - Science - Evolution - Computational Biology&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next one upped the ante:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;The Black Atheists Meetup&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't quite fit this with one of the previous recommendations but maybe it's because I've got a funny foreign name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London Growth Marketing Meetup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this just gotten random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Creative Circle (18-30)&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as I'd like to be eligible, I'm not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of IT and coding ones followed, until:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Indian Singles 30s and 40s Group&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'funny name' hypothesis is definitely correct. Although Meetup is still confused as to how old I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Crick Crack Storytelling Club&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Sapphic Salon&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this point, it got worse to the point of being random. I'd be harder on Meetup if most recommendation engine wasn't also crap (i.e. the way Amazon keeps pushing women's clothing and Frank Skinner DVDs at me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRRM writing flowchart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there incest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No:&lt;/strong&gt; MOAR INCEST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes:&lt;/strong&gt; (narrows eyes) Hurrrr ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quintessential GoT moment: a sex scene cuts to another sex scene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does everyone in this world know the legitimancy of every other person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravens - the mobile phone network of Westeros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daenerys can't look her dragon in the eye. Can't decide if it's bad CGI or just bad acting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Snow: &amp;quot;nice guy&amp;quot;. He'll be wearing a fedora before long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iron Isles: medieval libertarians&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a leader in Westeros, you need three things: bad hair, an
inflexible attitude and a terrible relationship with your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the incest-to-episode ratio has just passed 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arya: HELLO I AM A BOY AND TOTALLY NOT A GIRL IN DISGUISE. IGNORE MY
ROSY CHEEKS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time there's a scene change, I ask &amp;quot;where are we and who are these
people?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters can die at any point in a GRRM story, because there's so
many of them you have to conduct periodic culls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only three accents in Westeros - upper class English, working
class English and a strange generic eastern European.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRRM sure does love his comedy fat people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, everyone shits on Jon Snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this image of Brianna pledging loyalty to a succession of masters
who then suddenly &amp;quot;die&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's too late Brianna ... I'm mortally wounded ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My lord! Let me get help!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No - too late for that now. I'm going to perish. You'd better be
off to find a new master.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My lord, that cut hardly looks fatal ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is, I'm done for. And should you later see someone who looks
like me, that's just my twin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winterfell: And that's why you never leave a ten year old in charge of a
castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theon Greyjoy, you are useless. Even ten year olds doesn't respect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just realised that Robb Stark reminds me of Brett from Flight of the
Conchords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writers obviously thought that Joffery isn't despicable enough and
decided to eradicate the last bit of nuance in his character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom Stark is a total cockblocker. But if you lock your mother up for
treason, that's totally going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyrion keeps inserting syllables in that weird accent of his: &amp;quot;It's
called tac-a-tics not strat-eg-er-ee&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel sorry for any of the actresses on this show: it's only a matter
of time before they'll have to undress and play sex kitten for the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zombies? Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tywin Lannister: follows in the grand tradition of Westeros rulers by
treating everyone (including his children) like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Snow - still useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it say about the story that when a brother and sister show up
in the story, I'm waiting for incest to be mentioned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If George RR Martin wrote &amp;quot;Anna Karenina&amp;quot;, after 3 volumes Anna would
still be debating about whether to have an affair with Vronsky, Karenin
would be entangled in superfluous political subterfuge, and volumes
would have been devoted to Levin &amp;amp; Kitty's romance before they were
suddenly killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that given all the realistic features of a late
medieval world that are left out (infection, information travelling no
faster than horseback, the problems of a conscript army, etc.), they
choose to leave rape in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just realised: Lannister &amp;amp; Stark = Lancaster &amp;amp; York. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy fat person decides to stay behind and become a cook. Naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cersei and that strange woman from the north, Osha, could have an
eyebrow battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Jaime Lannister is so smug, it was just a matter of time
before someone maimed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait to see who Arya is kidnapped and held captive by next
season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when you think this show can't get any more cloth-eared, Jon Snow
invents oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comedy fat Crow doesn't know how to do anything. What exactly does the
Watch train them in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theon Greyjoy's entire plotline this season is: held captive, escapes
with help of mysterious ally, recaptured, rescued by mysterious ally who
then returns him to captivity and tortures him. Wait, what? Even the
IMDB summaries don't bother mentioning him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not Chekov's Gun, but Chekov's Dagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daenerys has just encountered a group of Australian mercenaries. I think
the lead mercenary is just angry he didn't get cast in the last season
of &amp;quot;Spartacus&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Daenerys does threaten, deliver ultimatums and lay waste to cities.
But she wants slaves to be free. So that's cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Wedding: I'm be more impressed if this story wasn't so stuffed with
characters that the cast could be halved without problems. And if there
was a decent motive behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have lost complete track of why Bran is headed north. But then, Osha
talks fondly of how well she was treated by the Starks, so even she
doesn't remember season 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that GRRM is ready to kill any character is like saying that with
Orson Scott Card you never know if a character will make it to the 3rd
or 4th sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sentence: I want all my project data accessible (readable and
writeable) on every computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm plagued constantly by wanting &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; dataset that's on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; computer
over there, being unable to tell if I've got the latest version of a
manuscript in front of me, having to …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="the-aim"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The aim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sentence: I want all my project data accessible (readable and
writeable) on every computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm plagued constantly by wanting &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; dataset that's on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; computer
over there, being unable to tell if I've got the latest version of a
manuscript in front of me, having to refer back to earlier versions to
justify some analysis and finding out I did that work on that other
machine ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these problems are mitigated by using cloud services (e.g.
Gmail, Mendeley), distributed version control (e.g. git) and
transferring files around (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive). But the issue
isn't broadly solved and I keep discovering that I need files and data
that are somewhere else. This is complicated by the fact that I work in
a heterogeneous environment. I'd prefer to do most work under Linux or
unix-like environments, there's the home Mac, workplaces often insist
that I use Windows, I have an Android tablet ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quotes below are from various forums and people I asked for their
experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-parameters"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The parameters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability: it's no good if 99% of files sync 99% of the time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No babysitting: a solution that takes care of itself and doesn't need constant attention (or any attention) is preferred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost: self-obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security: I've got no personal information on there, but there's no need to be cavalier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space: probably only a small amount of storage will be needed at first (i.e. a few gig) but this is certain to grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All files and all info: solutions that exclude files or transform them are right out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="suggested-solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suggested solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="google-drive"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Google for a lot of stuff (email etc.) so it seems natural to look
at Google Drive. It's very secure, the extra storage is cheap enough,
but I've found it incredibly unreliable: Some files just refuse to sync
or take ages to appear, seemingly without rhyme or reason. Broadly, the
sync seems to be a bit stupid. On Ubuntu there's no native client, but
Insync uses your Google space and seems to work well - although there
are also a few reports of it not syncing or excluding files. Google's
web UI isn't entirely to my liking either - it insists on treating
everything as sorted by keywords / tags and so deep folder hierarchies
are turned into a flat mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; secure, cheap storage, compatibility with other Google
services, web interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; no native Linux client, unreliable sync, weird web interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dropbox"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used Dropbox for years: it's reliable and &amp;quot;just works&amp;quot;. The Linux
client is good. (The Android client less so, but it's improving.) But
extra space isn't cheap and their patchy record on security gives me
pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; just works, web interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; expensive extra storage, dodgy security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sparkleshare"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SparkleShare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A git-based system for syncing and revising your work. While this seems
like a great idea - and does work well for small stuff - size and
performance starts to suffer with larger data, especially binaries. This
is apparently being looked at but there is no timetable for a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; it's git! And we can get git everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; problems with binaries and large files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="owncloud"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OwnCloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-hosted solution that needs a full LAMP stack on the server,
although that provides a nice web interface. There are mixed reports on
this one - some claimed that the software was slow and crashy on both
the client and server ends. Others said they'd &amp;quot;had no problems&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; web interface, self hosted so you can have as much space as
you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; self-hosted so you have to keep it running and working,
reliability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spideroak"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SpiderOak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpiderOak is basically a far more configurable Dropbox: you can point at
individual folders on individual machines and get them backed up into
the cloud, then linking any of those folders to the others be
synchronized. There's a web interface, a handy &amp;quot;share this folder on the
web&amp;quot; feature, a new &amp;quot;Hive&amp;quot; feature that basically duplicates Dropbox.
Also the whole thing is ridiculously secure, with all the data being
encrypted in transmission and storage, to the point that SpiderOak HQ
says if you lose your password, they are unable to help you. On the down
side, when a new folder or machine is introduced, it seems to be very
slow to propagate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt; security, does everything Dropbox does, configurability,
Android client&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt; extra storage is not cheap, client may be slow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="others"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bewildering array of solutions for this, so many that a lot
had to be dismissed for fairly minor reasons (small user base, a lot of
software installation, &amp;quot;techy&amp;quot;, etc.). Solutions not examined in depth
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seafile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roll my own manual solution using rsync: charming but I'd have to trigger it myself (although a cron job could be written) and I've got enough else to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jungle Disk: reported to have a slow client and dodgy synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syncany: not ready and by one report &amp;quot;probably never will be&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Box.net: no official Linux client &amp;quot;but if you have root and can install WebDAV you should be able to make it work&amp;quot;. Urgh, no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bittorrent Sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wuala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SugarSync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcasa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SkyDrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tresorit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syncplicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple iCloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;git-annex assistant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sparkleshare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tahoe-LAFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with SpiderOak. US$10 a month gives me 100G and after 3 months it
seems to be working fine. True, the initial upload and sync was sluggish
(a few days for 10G) but this may have been effected by a poor internet
connection here. The ability to configure it for multiple folders has
proven to be surprisingly handy - I sync up my project folder, ebooks
folder and image folder. (The music will be next.) And it needs no
attention and just does its job in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, Dropbox will be a fine solution for most people.
Certainly the storage is expensive, but if you've only got a little data
and are a bit canny with their referrals bonuses, it should be enough.
It's inflexible being a single folder, but again that will suit a lot of
people. Most of all, it just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="also-see"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Also see&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/five-best-cloud-storage-providers-614393607"&gt;Lifehacker looks at the choices and come to different conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing demise of Google Reader (July 1), like a lot of other
people I've been looking for a replacement. And - like a lot of other
people - I haven't been finding what I wanted and so the search for a
replacement has gone done to the wire. Here are some of the notes I've
made about the candidates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="assumptions-needs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assumptions &amp;amp; needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used GReader for scanning through journals and job ads, so the replacement should be to that all business / quick filter-and-forget style (and probably is thus fairly graphics light)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I read/scan feeds on the desktop and via an Android tablet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has to import from GReader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Folders or other organisation is essential (today I want to read about stats, tomorrow I will want to look at pictures of cats ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="candidates"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Candidates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inoreader"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inoreader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feature-packed (tags, social integration, folders, subscribe from browser ...)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Android reader yet but one is one the way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does all other features needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice lean look&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a very new service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="newsblur"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acclaimed hosted service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$24 / year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android app has dire reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fever"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actually a pay-for and host-your-own service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some nifty filtering services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some Android clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lord, I am so not hosting my own service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tiny-rss"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tiny RSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;another host-your-own service, albeit free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Android clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="feed-wrangler"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feed Wrangler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several clients on different platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;paid service, $19 a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="feedbin"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feedbin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several clients on different platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;paid service, $2/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="netvibes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NetVibes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more of a business intelligence platform for handling various incoming medias but does do RSS feeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a free version but it seems there are limits and the whole capability of the platform is very unclear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="feedly"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feedly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used to use gReader data, has now developed own service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tends to very graphical look, but can be customised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has Android clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the default choice for many moving from GReader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="digg"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;says they are developing their own, but there's no no sign of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their current apps are iOS only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="flowreader"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FlowReader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seems to do most of the reading fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imported my GReader feeds without issue but I can't scroll down to the bottom feeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no Android client?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CurataReader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks nice but there's a lot of unused white on the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also there's junky HTML/Javascript code coming through many of my feeds&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment, InoReader and Feedly are the way to go. The former has
the features and the &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; look that I want, the latter has the
clients and user-friendliness. There's a lot of pretty readers with big
and bright interfaces (leaving most of the screen unused) and what I'd
really like is something more compact, where I can whip through dozens
of feeds quickly and see if there's anything I'm interested in.
Something like Google Reader, actually, which on reflection was damn
good at what it did. It just worked, which is the highest praise you can
give a bit of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many scientists, I make lots of notes: cribsheets, reading summaries, analysis details, ideas ... and I end up with a huge volume of paper, boxes of old journals and notebooks. Not only does this take up a large amount of room, but it's also difficult to search and related …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="background"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many scientists, I make lots of notes: cribsheets, reading summaries, analysis details, ideas ... and I end up with a huge volume of paper, boxes of old journals and notebooks. Not only does this take up a large amount of room, but it's also difficult to search and related materials are scattered across multiple books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, for a long time I've been searching for a digital solution, something would allow handwritten notes to be stored and searched.  The below is a quick comparison of apps to acheive this. Soft requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should work with any page, with no special paper or pens required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaning up and straightening scan if need be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OCR, taking handwriting to searchable text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frictionless exporting of resulting image to useful organisational tool or system, like Evernote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="general-results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the solutions below are Android apps, with scanning done via a Samsung S6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a huge number of possible programs out there and I mostly looked at just obvious candidates, dismissing those with medicore reviews or unprofessional appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprisingly, especially given how many packages boast of image filters and options for cleaning up scans, scan quality is roughly equivalent across apps. Light level and direction can make a huge direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OCR quality was disappointing, but that's probably the consequence of device limitations (processing on a mobile device), technical limitations (OCR is hard) and my terrible handwriting. Those apps that use a central service to convert fared much better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, any program that can export to Evernote can leave the OCR to its impressive qualities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost is a tricky issue. Often the most important features of a scanning app will be locked away in a &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; version or subscription. Which is understadable but makes them difficult to assess. Complicating this is that some apps come in several versions and it can be hard to see what you pay and what you get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the apps tested use &amp;quot;special paper&amp;quot;, i.e. pages marked up such that an associated app can better recognise page limits and text. Obviously there are considerations here (especially the cost of the paper), but here I'm just looking at process downstream of scanning, i.e. if I was to use this system, how does the scan and OCR work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="individual-approaches"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Individual approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="adobe-scan"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adobe Scan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use the camera to photograph and scan any page and is good at framing the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scan results are good, and are automatically straightened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OCR ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The results can be synced to the &amp;quot;Adobe Cloud&amp;quot; or emailed, which is not so useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="abbyy-finescanner"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ABBYY FineScanner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABBYY is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; high-end scanning program and comes with the expected eye-watering price. There is a free version which this is based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use the camera to photograph and scan any page and is good at framing the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scan results are good - although perhaps best with black-and-white - and are automatically straightened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OCR is behind the subscription paywall, although a trial conversion simply returned the gnomic &amp;quot;not recognised&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing is basically only emailing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="clearscanner"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ClearScanner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the usual recommendations given on forums, CS gives a clear results and exports to just about anywhere (Box, GoogleDrive, email, Evernote ...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notebloc is a &amp;quot;special paper&amp;quot; solution with an application that looks near identical to ClearScanner,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tinyscanner"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TinyScanner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold as a basic, no-frills scanner, TS certainly is that. While the scan quality is fine, it had some troubles framing the images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intsig-camscanner"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IntSig CamScanner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rocketbook"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RocketBook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RB is a &amp;quot;special paper&amp;quot; solution - you write in special books and scan them with RB's own app. The cost of the books is eyewatering but the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="whitelines"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Whitelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="evernote"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Evernote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get your notes into Evernote, why note just let Evernote do the scanning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Evernote camera will photograph and scan any page. It's so-so at framing the page, with a little bit of jittering around that maybe the result of low light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scan results are decent, although a shaky faint pen stroke seemed to get slightly degraded. Scans are automatically straightened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OCR (in Evernote) is so-so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, it's easy to get the results into Evernote. Consecutive pages can be placed in the same document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

was time to move to a new machine. One of the great aspects of Apple's
Time Machine backup software is how easy it makes it to do this - start
the new machine up, plugin the backup in, after a while your disk will
appear as it was, more or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is about the more or less - the hiccups and issues
encountered. To be fair to Apple, these mostly concern non-Apple
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="technical-details"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The backup is coming from a MacBook circa 2007 running OS X 10.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is going to a MacBook Pro mid-2012 running OS X 10.8.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="google-drive"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... naturally fails. It reports that it can't find the Google Drive
folder even if you point the software at it. From previous experience,
there is only one solution for this - create a new GDrive folder and let
the contents be re-downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="backblaze"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backblaze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cloud backup does something unexpected but extremely logical when
transferred to a new computer - it stops backing up. The service reasons
that if a new computer is attached to an old backup, the most sensible
thing to do is to preserve the old backup (making it &amp;quot;frozen&amp;quot;) in case
of error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately exchanging the backup to your new machine is awkward. You
have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set up a backup from the new machine (which is added to your account as a time-limited trial)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from the webpage for your account, check that both old and new machines are on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete the old backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transfer the license to the new machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unfortunately means that backup-wise you're flapping in the breeze
for a while: the new machine has to upload itself entirely, building a
wholly new backup. At Backblaze's usual speeds, this could take days or
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: Backblaze can sometimes be a little piggy - the backup process
occasionally consumes 0.5G of memory. I switched to a once-a-day backup
schedule for after midnight to keep it out of my hair.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="spotlight"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight is notorious for getting out of hand and continually
re-indexing, consuming CPU. (Look for the &lt;em&gt;mdsworker&lt;/em&gt; process as a sight
of this happening.) A common solution is to exclude from
Spotlight certain problematic folders that are constantly changing but
contain nothing interesting, e.g. cache and temporary folders including
those associated with Backblaze. However, the list of excluded folders
isn't carried across in a Time Machine restore, so you have to set them
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to exclude &lt;em&gt;/Library&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;/System/Library&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;~/Library&lt;/em&gt;, which
captures the Backblaze files. Note that to select the ~/Library folder -
which is hidden normally under OSX - can be shown in the select folder
dialog by pressing &lt;em&gt;cmd-shift-.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mendeley"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendeley&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is possibly un-related to the upgrade procedure and just happened
at the same time coincidentally. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-upgrade, Mendeley was a little fragile - crashing occasionally,
repairing the database, etc. Alerted to the availability of an update, I
installed the new version. Whereupon Mendeley would crash within minutes
of starting. If re-opened, it would repair the database, then crash.
Rinse and repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this ended up being the removal of Mendeley totally from
the system, including any data and preference files (use Spotlight to
search for them) and reinstallation. Mendeley then re-syncs your library
including papers with the cloud storage, which takes forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="devtools-and-macports"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DevTools and MacPorts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt; and other unix commandline things will
probably be broken by the upgrade. Time to reinstall everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets a bit messy. You can now install and maintain DevTools from
the AppStore - which is a Good Thing - but it seems that this will
install XCode in &lt;em&gt;/Applications&lt;/em&gt;, where as older versions of XCode
installed in &lt;em&gt;/Developer&lt;/em&gt;. So you can end up with two versions of XCode
on the one machine. Beware ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having installed XCode, run it and install the commandline tools (find
these in &lt;em&gt;Preferences &amp;gt; Downloads&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacPorts is broken horribly by an upgrade. There is a  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration"&gt;migration
guide&lt;/a&gt; offered, but this is
essentially &amp;quot;uninstall and reinstall it&amp;quot;.  Do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="disk-space"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disk space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a suspicion that moving computers and disks leads to cruft
accumulating on the disk and consuming space. This is admittedly
unproven and based solely on what seems to be the disappearance of spare
room on the disk during transfers. It's therefore useful to cleanup the
disk of large and useless files. I suggest these methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a disk mapping program like Grand Perspective to see where the large files are on your disk. (By this method I was able to spot and delete several bulky virtual machine images, some pathologically large PDFs and a gigabyte of temporary files created by &lt;em&gt;Graphic Converter&lt;/em&gt;, which I hadn't used in years.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the appropriate version of &lt;em&gt;Onyx&lt;/em&gt; and use it to flush cache and temporary files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housekeeping programs like &lt;em&gt;Hazel&lt;/em&gt; - which keeps track of what files are installed and created by an application - can be invaluable when deleting old and useless applications from your disk. Otherwise the cruft from long-deleted apps can hang around forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you need to extract and save an image that is part of a
Microsoft Word document, that you can't get any other way. For example,
you might need a copy of an institutional logo that is only present as …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A simple problem, solved in a simple way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you need to extract and save an image that is part of a
Microsoft Word document, that you can't get any other way. For example,
you might need a copy of an institutional logo that is only present as
part of a template document. (Thanks HPA directorate.) Strangely, Word
makes this quite difficult. Once a picture has been imported into a
document, it's integrated there - forever. No save or export commands or
options are provided for the now-native image, you can only change the
image or delete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of suggested solutions on the web: drag to desktop
(didn't work for me), save as a &lt;em&gt;.docx&lt;/em&gt;, unzip and extract the assets
(ditto), paste into a Powerpoint document (missing the point there).
Buts there's a simple and obvious solution: save the document as HTML.
This will produce a webpage and a folder (called &lt;em&gt;blahblah_files&lt;/em&gt;). The
image(s) will be in this folder. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the purchase of a new computer and a new hard-drive for an old
computer, the installer for a much-loved game (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ticket2ridegame.com/"&gt;Ticket to

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the purchase of a new computer and a new hard-drive for an old
computer, the installer for a much-loved game (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ticket2ridegame.com/"&gt;Ticket to
Ride&lt;/a&gt;) would choke half-way through
with a repeated series of &amp;quot;could not write&amp;quot; error messages for various
components of the app. This happened on both machines, despite the fact
that it had previously been installed on one, and that the OS version
and selection of extensions hadn't changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="diagnosis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CD was unmarked and apparently uncorrupt. Dragging the installer to
a disk and running it from there ended with the exact same problem.
Interestingly, just before this trouble, I had also had problems with
other applications that were installed by simply dragging into the
'Applications' folder. OSX would report that I did not have permission
and had to authenticate with my root password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran 'Disk Utility' and repaired permissions on both disks. &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt;
that I had installed on both systems had changed the permissions subtly
on the 'Applications' folder so that installers would fail as they
didn't have root access. (Later experience shows that several Java
installers appear to be the culprits.) Fixing permissions solved this.
Just why OSX is so vulnerable to corrupt permissions is a mystery. The
OS comes with an application to repair them. Isn't there a better
solution?&lt;/p&gt;

labouriously change change keyboard layout everytime you swap languages,
and have to remember where how the Cyrillic characters are arranged. You
could install some sort of virtual keyboard or chart (e.g. PopChar) and
play hunt-and-peck, but that get's old real fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A useful solution I've found is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jtranslit.sourceforge.net"&gt;jTranslit&lt;/a&gt;. This is just a
straightforward, simple Java app that presents a space for you to type
into. It watches what you type and makes substitutions, sometimes based
on consequent pairs of characters. So, for example. jTranslit
transliterates &amp;quot;dela&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;????&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small problem is that the transliteration scheme used isn't specified
or documented. Mostly, it just makes sense and verves close (but not
exactly) to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translit"&gt;Translit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian"&gt;GOST 1971&lt;/a&gt;. For the greater internet good,
here is what my experimentation has revealed: with a few modifications.
Divergences from GOST are marked with an asterisk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the Microsoft Office programs - Word, Outlook, Excel etc - lose
their soothing, sleek modern look for a weird, lo-fi, monochrome
appearance, as if the graphics have been reduced to 16bit or reverted to
Word 97. Most noticeable is the way that the window buttons (shrink /
maximize / close) revert from their modern / 2007 to blocky low-rez
versions. The really strange part is that it seems to only affect the
MSOffice applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;just happened&amp;quot; one day without any &lt;em&gt;apparent&lt;/em&gt; system change or
software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where similar problems are reported across the web, various well-meaning or logical solutions are suggested around the place - toggle monitor color depth, update monitor drivers, check accessibility settings, change Office or system theme. None of these work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root problem is another video driver somehow grabbing control. The
culprit is sometimes figured as the &amp;quot;SMS mirror driver&amp;quot;, although in my
case it was the &amp;quot;LANDesk remote control mirror driver&amp;quot;. Find the rogue
driver at &lt;em&gt;My Computer -&amp;gt; Properties -&amp;gt; Hardware -&amp;gt; Device driver -&amp;gt;
Display adapters&lt;/em&gt;. Disable this and restart your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear whether the problem was provoked by a sysadmin updating
the driver in the background, or if it's something that just happens
randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trading out of debt&lt;/h2&gt;

the spot. However, the player can trade to raise money to pay this debt

money to pay …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="trading-out-of-debt"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading out of debt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If placed into debt, a player must pay a debt as fully as possible on
the spot. However, the player can trade to raise money to pay this debt
if need be. But this trading can only take place if it raises enough
money to pay the debt. If it does not, all trades are cancelled and the
debtor's property is handed over (the standard bankruptcy rule). So if
you have no cash and land on a £500 rent property, and another player
offers to buy a property off you for £800, that deal can be accepted and
the money used to pay the debt. If the offer is for £300, the deal
cannot be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale is that it makes sense that a player who is rich in property
should not be ruined by a momentary poverty in cash. However, trading to
get out of debt can be abused by a debtor. If driven to bankruptcy, they
could sell all their property for a token price before it is taken off
them as a &amp;quot;fuck-you&amp;quot; move. Therefore if any trading is allowed, it must
be genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-charging-rent-and-cooperative-play"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Not) charging rent and cooperative play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing in the rules that states that a property must collect a
full amount rent when it is incurred. In fact &lt;em&gt;on the spot&lt;/em&gt; deals can be
made - the property owner can let the rent slide, accept a lesser amount
or take property instead. The only limitation on any deal made is that
it must be instant - a deal cannot be made that involves any future
behaviour or transaction (e.g. &amp;quot;You can pay me next turn&amp;quot;). Put another
way, deals can only be held to the moment. You could accept a deal that
invokes future behaviour, but there's nothing enforcing such a deal. You
have to take it on trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting tactic where two or more players can form a
cooperative, where they agree to not charge each other rent. In the mid-
to end-game, this makes for a killer combination. The cooperative
players are effectively playing against one less opponent and so in a 6
player game will be paying 20% less rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to legislate against this style of play because an
occasional leniency in charging rent and full cooperation are points on
the same spectrum. Perhaps it is self-limiting, because other players
can always form a cooperative in response. There is also a big
temptation for cooperative members to defect when the chance comes for a
lucrative rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="free-parking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free parking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common house rule is putting all taxes and fines into a pot, to be won
by anyone who lands on &lt;em&gt;Free parking&lt;/em&gt;. Schlumberger (in &lt;em&gt;New Rules for Classic Games&lt;/em&gt;) argues heavily against this, pointing out that adds more randomness to an already random game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="start-order"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point made by Schlumberger is that the order players start in has a great effect. On the first move, players can land on 11 different spaces. (Actually, 95% of the time it will distributed 9 different spaces, 66% of the item within just 5 spaces.) There are but 6 properties in these 11 spaces. This first player has the chance to land on any and maybe buy them. By the time the last player moves, at least some of these will have been bought. Thus they may not only miss out on a chance to buy, but they may also be fined. The bunching of possible moves only enhances this possibility. Thus, the later players are at an increasing disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution would be to compensate later players with money. Another would be to auction off the starting position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shorter-games"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shorter games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play drags on for far too long, past the point where it's clear who is going to win (or who is going to lose), so an early endpoint is called for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a money limit. Whoever reaches this first, wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a time limits, or a certain number of times around the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute or auction off a few properties before the game starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="symptoms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragging a file fails in the Mac Finder. Files may be selected but they
will not move with the cursor. This behaviour extends to the Dock -
icons cannot be dragged out of the dock, although their context / popup
menus still appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files may still be moved with the Terminal (i.e mv). Other
point-and-click actions in the Finder are fine (e.g. double-click to
open). Dragging continues to work in other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="environment"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSX Leopard 10.5.3 on a MacBook 2.1. Reports appear to show that this is
largely (but not exclusively) a Leopard problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="possible-solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart machine. This fixes it for a while, but it recurs eventually
usually after the machine has slept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart Finder. No effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete preference file com.apple.finder.plist. No effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete .DS_Store files. No effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checked disk for errors and permission problems. None. (Strangely,
about a week after first noticing this bug, my hard disk crashed
terminally. So maybe there is something about unseen disk corruption
going on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flushed caches etc. with Onyx. Required a restart, but problem
recurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some reports suggested reinstalling the OS (!). However followup
reports show that this wasn't a&amp;nbsp;permanent&amp;nbsp;fix ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an interesting report that the common extension Quicksilver
may be implicated, with the developer calling it one of his oldest
and unreproducible bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mouse or trackpad, no difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset mouse &amp;amp; trackpad preferences.&amp;nbsp;No effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other report alleges Finder problems in connection with Stuffit's
context menu or changing permissions. Untested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No crash report logged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other have reset permissions, zapped PRAM, booted into safe mode,
logged in as different users, to no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One user alleges that switching to another app and back fixes it. No
effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File bug with Apple. No reply as yet ...&lt;/li&gt;

with the machine. The performance is excellent, the physical form-factor
good, the price acceptable, the included devices (camera, IR port)
handy. There have been reports about the MacBook Pro line concerning
battery problems and over-heating &lt;a class="reference external" href="macbook-heat.html#id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; , and some of these mentioned
similar issues on the MacBook &lt;a class="reference external" href="macbook-heat.html#id6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="macbook-heat.html#id5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; . For the first two weeks, I
didn't encounter these. The machine was hot, no doubt, but it could be
sat on my lap without risk of burns. The battery life was excellent,
running about 4 hours depending on what the machine was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one night as I was using the MacBook, it suddenly ran out of
power. It had been fully charged less than 2 hours ago and used since
only for web-browsing and editing. Still, perhaps it had been
incorrectly plugged in. The next day, the same thing happened. And the
following day. I made sure the battery was fully charged up, unplugged
and checked the power item in the menu. Estimated remaining battery time
was 96%, 1 hour 50 minutes and falling. As I watched, in less than 5
minutes the remaining time decreased to 1 hour 30 minutes. The battery
appeared to be failing, but calling IOReg showed that the its amperage
and characteristics were at nominal or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, the MacBook started running a lot hotter. It was
uncomfortable to place on a lap for any period of time. The fan ran all
the time, regardless of what the machine was doing. Leaving the computer
plugged in and open (i.e. with the lid up) overnight, in the morning the
fan would still running. Only if the lid was closed, would the MacBook
cool down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not initially connect these two phenomena. However, in studying
the heat problem the link became clear. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html"&gt;Temperature Monitor&lt;/a&gt; showed
that the two CPUs were running at 79-80C and the harddrive at 37C, even
when the computer was apparently doing nothing. The CPUs were working
all the time, so the fan was going all the time and so the battery was
runing down from driving the fan constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was thrashing the CPUs? The machine was responsive enough. I
ran &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; to look for clues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
1547 YahooWidgetEngine 160% 12:26:57 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;160% of processor time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://widgets.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo! Widgets&lt;/a&gt; gets something right that Apple's Dashboard doesn't.
Dashboard widgets exist in an application &amp;quot;layer&amp;quot; of their own, which
makes them more difficult to access or use. (Of what use is a compact
iTunes controller widget if you have to swap applications to get to it?
Why not just swap to iTunes?) In contrast, Yahoo Widgets lets you set
the layer the widget exists in -- the YW layer, floating on top of
everything else, etc. -- a far more useful interface. So I'd been using
it instead of Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Yahoo Widgets seemed to be churning the processors, albeit politely
since it didn't do it if other applications were demanding CPU time. I
quit the application, and then used kill -9 on YahooWidgetEngine process
as it appeared to keep running. Within minutes, the computer
temperatures were down to far more polite 52C (for the CPUs) and 30C
(for the harddrive). When fully charged, battery life returned to the 4
hour mark. Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yahoo Widget Engine keeps the MacBook (and possibly
other machine models) CPUs running constantly, even when there is no
need. With the CPUs running all the time, temperatures rise, the fans
run non-stop, and battery life is shortened. No doubt there are other
causes of similar problems - this is just what was going on in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GFC/97X - GENERIC FAN COMPLAINT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just come back from seeing the long-awaited adaptation of the classic _____. It was terrible! It was full of glaring errors and unnecessary changes like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ has the wrong &lt;em&gt;[accent / hair colour / facial expression]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ says _____, but in the original he actually says _____&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always imagined the city of ____ would look like _____ and not _____&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relationship between _____ and _____ just wasn't right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leaving out all the &lt;em&gt;[poems / songs / bestiality]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also mad that they omitted the vital character of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____'s &lt;em&gt;[brother / sister / father / mentor / sidekick/ turtle]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;em&gt;[barkeep / general / wizard]&lt;/em&gt;  at the &lt;em&gt;[inn / base / mystic Elven village of Elrohéremélossëhelin na Telperiën]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second trooper to the left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the entire backstory concerning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____'s rivalry with _____&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;____'s fear of &lt;em&gt;[spiders / snakes/ heights/ death]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the childhood of ______&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the entire lineage of ______, including births, deaths, marriages, divorces, illegitimacies, pets, and house renovations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a betrayal of _____'s vision. Why, the author must&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be spinning in their grave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;laughing all the way to the bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the producers even bother to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read the book?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read the manga?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch the original?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consult the fans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kill a goat and read its entrails?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first encountered _____ at school. I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;laughed non-stop for days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collapsed and wept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immediately bought the rest of the series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;went through puberty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it looked so cheap too! You could totally tell it was filmed in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sydney&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vancouver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toronto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an Eastern European country with low wages and minimal labour laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_____ was completely wrong as the character of _____. They should have cast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orlando Bloom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samuel L Jackson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jessica Alba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keanu Reeves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure it might be alright if you're&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not a fan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn't read the special small press issue with a limited run of 12 that came out in the early 80s and is OMGWTFBBQ totally brilliant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an oxygen-breather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but Hollywood totally failed to do justice to it! Why didn't they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a 17 hour version, so they could fit everything in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a trilogy, so they could fit everything in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a television series, so they could fit everything in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;film absolutely all of it and release it on the DVD as extras, so they could fit everything in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure thousands if not millions of fans would pay for that! In fact, we should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write a petition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start a campaign to raise money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so angry that I'm going to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post my opnion on a dozen forums, complaining bitterly to anyone who will listen&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and announce loudly that I'm going to transfer my allegiance to a fandom that deserves me, like&lt;/p&gt;

will allow you to scan sections of books and save them as images or
recognised text. As someone who sifts through a lot of information
everyday, I was interested in an easy quick way of getting data from
books and papers into a single and searchable database. There aren't
many solutions on the Macintosh and (as of the time of writng) the
IRISPen has been on special at the Apple store for an entirely
reasonable price (circa 70 poounds). The reviews on the web are,
frankly, mixed. For some people it worked exactly as advertised, others
found the text recognition inadequate, for some it refused to work at
all. So, with my eyes open, I bought one to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It installed easily. The pen worked fine ... once. Then it stopped
working and nothing, nothing could fix it. Not a reboot, not deletion of
preference files, not reinstallation, not downloading and installing the
latest version of the software. In fact, the driver software was
something out of Kafka. You set your default langauge as English. The
software sets it to Spanish. You set it to English again. It sets it to
Spanish. You set it to English. It takes, the popup information window
saying &amp;quot;English&amp;quot;. You breathe a sigh of relief and quit the software.
Later you return to it. It says Spanish. The pen lights up and scans a
page but nothing ever appears in the output window. The troubleshooting
section of the manual helpfully suggests using the &amp;quot;calibrate&amp;quot; option on
one of the menus, an option that was never enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent it back. The Apple Store - to their credit - gave me a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; avoid. Zero stars.&lt;/p&gt;

deceptive, annoying and inconvenient. If you use an iPod, the last is
certainly true. How do you get RealAudio track playing on your iPod?
Despite some moves by Real towards compatibility, meanwhiles you have to
convert to some useful format like MP3. Unfortunately, getting an audio
converter to understand the Real format can be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution that will work on any platform is to use one of the many
&amp;quot;eavesdropping&amp;quot; applications, that will record the output of another
program, computer or stream: AudioHijack, Wiretap, Streamripper, etc.
Just play the stream and have the converting program listen in and
record. The main problem with this is that it will take the length of
the program to convert it. Otherwise ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="windows"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those jobs that is a lot easier under Windows. While a
number of solutions have been suggested, the most straightforward is to
use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nch.com.au/switch/index.html"&gt;Switch music
converter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you do that, so that Switch can understand RealAudio, you
have to install the Real codecs (libraries for interpreting compressed
media) onto your system. The obvious way to do this is to obtain and
install RealPlayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier said that done. The RealPlayer has a history of being it hard to
find on the Real website (buried behind multiple &amp;quot;opportunities&amp;quot; to buy
the full version of the player). It also has a nasty habit of insisting
on taking over every media file on your system. It's much easier to
find, download and install the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/audiohelp_install.shtml"&gt;BBC branded
RealPlayer&lt;/a&gt; When
it asks for your name, email and personal details (so you can be sent
&amp;quot;important&amp;quot; announcements and offers) you can just enter bogus details.
When it asks what media types you want it to handle, select the
&amp;quot;Advanced&amp;quot; option and then deselect everything but the actual Real media
formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and install the Switch converter. Start it up, add the
RealAudio files to the input list. Select MP3 as the output format.
Convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="macintosh"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macintosh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no solution on that Macintosh that works for me.
While an OSX version of Switch is available, it doesn't seem to
recognise Real files regardless of what other applications or codecs are
installed. A slightly complicated solution involving mplayer, a shell
script and free codecs &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050130184054216&amp;amp;query=mplayer"&gt;has been
proposed&lt;/a&gt;,
but I've been unable to make it work, perhaps because library names have
changed since it was written. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040208192926475&amp;amp;query=RealAudio"&gt;Music
Safari&lt;/a&gt;
(now called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitcartel.com/raw/"&gt;iRecord&lt;/a&gt;?) looks
promising but isn't fully functional until paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

slightly backwards part of Australia., second only to South Australia
for its obscurity &lt;a class="reference external" href="talk-queenslandish.html#ref1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. However, over the years I've come to remember
Queensland speech with some affection, a dialect in which it is possible
to have an hour long conversation that consists of a dozen repeated
mono-syllabic grunts and not a single hard consonant. Indeed, if the
world was to adopt the Queensland tongue, Ludwig Zamenhof's &lt;a class="reference external" href="talk-queenslandish.html#ref2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; dream
would be fulfilled and we could all live in harmony, the only arguments
being those over exactly how &amp;quot;bloody hot&amp;quot; it is and whose turn it is to
get the beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of the Australian slang dictionaries list regional slang,
they seem to be mostly the product of someone with an overly active
imagination. To this end, I present this brief introduction to the
speech patterns and vocabulary of Queensland. A warning: visitors to
Queensland should not attempt to use this slang or to imitate the
accent, as being called &amp;quot;a wanker&amp;quot; may offend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="general-principles"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-accent"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The accent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, Queenslanders follow the rural Australian accent,
which is slow and twangy. However, Queenslanders' voices are less harsh,
being softer, breathier and flatter. (This may make it sound quite
attractive. Be disabused of this notion immediately.) The sound can be
approximated by speaking through your nose and one side of your mouth,
while squinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-ubiquitous-mono-syllable"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The ubiquitous mono-syllable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use ten words when clearing your throat will do just as well?
Queenslanders have large and subtle repertoire of mono-syllables and
grunts they can deploy as conversational shorthand. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-rising-ey-at-the-end-of-a-sentence"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A rising &amp;quot;ey?&amp;quot; at the end of a sentence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many Canadians, Queenslanders have the habit of tacking a
querulous &amp;quot;ey?&amp;quot; on the end of every sentence. This translates as &lt;em&gt;This
thing that I have just said, is it not most worthy and correct? If you
do not say otherwise, I shall assume so!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-protracted-arhhh-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A protracted &amp;quot;arhhh ...&amp;quot; at the beginning of a sentence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piratical device beloved of former Australian Prime Minister Bob
Hawke, this roughly means: &lt;em&gt;I have something of the greatest importance
to say. However, as I have not yet figured out what it exactly is, this
extended groan will serve as a placeholder for the time being.&lt;/em&gt; Thus, it
is impolite to interrupt someone &amp;quot;mid-arhhh&amp;quot;, for they have already
started talking, even if their speech is as yet devoid of nouns, verbs,
a subject, any objects, or in fact any words at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="an-extended-rising-falling-ohhhhh-as-a-response"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An extended rising &amp;amp; falling &amp;quot;ohhhhh!&amp;quot; as a response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing this peppered through conversations, an outsider might surmise
that Queenslanders are in a perpetual state of faint surprise at
everything. In reality, this has a looser meaning along the lines:
&lt;em&gt;Although I am tongue-tied, what you say is interesting, and you should
continue, for I have nothing to contribute at this point.&lt;/em&gt; For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The spare key is in the kitchen drawer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ohhhhh!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And saurian-like aliens have invaded our planet, dooming us to
life-long imprisonment in their vast subterranean meat-factories,
where our children will grow up as stunted albinos, having never
seen the sun.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ohhhhh!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-sibilant-duo-syllable"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The sibilant duo-syllable&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's an Australia-wide habit to abbreviate words, Queenslanders
excel in this practice, hacking any words longer than two syllables down
to just one and then tacking on a random vowel. Actually words of one
syllables are often lengthened to two, and those with two syllables
mutated to match this pattern. Hence, at the University
of Queensland, engineering students were called &amp;quot;engies&amp;quot;, journalism
students &amp;quot;journos&amp;quot;, music students &amp;quot;musos&amp;quot; and pharmacy students
&amp;quot;pharmos&amp;quot;. Personal names are often composed in the same way: &amp;quot;Gazza&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Warny&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Poida&amp;quot;. Also see &lt;em&gt;postie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brizzie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;rego&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;truckie&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Gabba&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;rellies&lt;/em&gt; and many, many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rhyming-slang"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rhyming slang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, many Australian vocabulary guides have long lists of
opaque rhyming slang. No one ever, ever speaks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="obsolete-slang"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Obsolete slang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to old movies and the actions of over-enthusiastic and sentimental
natives, there is a whole list of supposed slang that hasn't actually
been used in the last 50 years. For example: &amp;quot;bonza&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cobber&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;corker&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sheila&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;strewth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-words"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;This list is very much in progress. Also, many of the words are not restricted to Queensland, but are favourites of the natives. Thus I've included them. Any contributions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;aerial ping pong&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Australian rules football. In the UK and most of the world,
&amp;quot;football&amp;quot; usually means soccer. In the USA, it means gridiron.
In Queensland, it means rugby. By contrast, in Victoria
(the south), it means &amp;quot;Australian rules&amp;quot;, a mobile and quick game
with some resemblance to Gaelic football, although no one is really
sure where it came from. In any event, Queenslanders regard Aussie
rules as an effete abomination of their own rugged and violent
sport.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Asian&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In Australia, this means &amp;quot;from south-east Asia&amp;quot; - China, Japan,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia etc. etc. In the UK, &amp;quot;Asian&amp;quot; refers to
the Indian subcontinent - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh - whom
Australians blithely group together as &amp;quot;Indians&amp;quot;, which I'm told is roughly
congruent with the US meaning.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;banana bender&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Someone from Queensland. Note that Queenslanders never use this word
themselves. Never ever ever.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bastard&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Not necessarily a bad word, often used for comic or dramatic effect
as in &amp;quot;you bastard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dumb bastard&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;who was the stupid bastard
that suggested that?&amp;quot;. The word &amp;quot;mongrel&amp;quot; has a similar usage.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;beer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In Australia, &amp;quot;beer&amp;quot; always, always means &amp;quot;lager&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;blue&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Used to mean (1) an argument or quarrel, or (2) the default nickname
for someone who has fair skin and red hair, or (3) a type of cattle dog (blue heelers). In a few centuries, Queensland
vocabulary will probably consist solely of this word and a series of
surprised grunts.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bonus&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An exclamation of surprise and delight.&amp;quot;I won the casket! Bonus!&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bottle shop&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What you durn foreigners would call a liquor store or off-license.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bevan&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Derogatory term for someone working class or from the wrong side of
town. You could argue it's to do with them being uneducated and
working class, but it's really more to do with them wearing &lt;em&gt;ugg
boots&lt;/em&gt; and flannel shirts, driving panel vans and listening to heavy
rock. You know a bevan when you see one. Known in Melbourne as
&amp;quot;bogans&amp;quot; and Sydney as &amp;quot;westies&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;big smoke&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The big city.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bilby&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macrotis lagotis&lt;/em&gt; or the rabbit-eared bandicoot. Looking like a
cross between a mouse and a minute kangaroo, this cute little fellow
lives in the arid deserts of Australia. In recent years it's been
adopted as an indigenous replacement for the Easter Bunny - rabbits
being a major pest in Australia - and shops have started selling
chocolate bilbies. Unfortunately, the bilby population is slowly
dying out. There's something peculiarly Australian about replacing a
traditional fertility symbol with an animal that has trouble
reproducing.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bloke&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A man, used in the same sense as &amp;quot;guy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fella&amp;quot;. As in: &amp;quot;Who
called earlier?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I dunno, some bloke.&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bludger&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Someone lazy. Usually used in the sense of unemployment, as per the
radio shock-jock's favourite phrase &amp;quot;dole bludger&amp;quot;. Can also be used
as a noun (&amp;quot;having a bludge&amp;quot;) or verb (&amp;quot;can I bludge off you?&amp;quot;).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bodum&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Universal word for cafetieres or french press coffee makers, and a
glowing tribute to the dedication of the marketing division of the
Bodum kettle company.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Brisbane&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Pronounced &lt;em&gt;BRIZbin&lt;/em&gt;. The capital of Queensland. Also called
&amp;quot;Brizzie&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Brisvegas&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A recent name for Brisbane, not always used ironically. Its origin
is obscure, but probably refers to Brisbane's efforts to turn itself
from a sleepy regional centre into a bustling international
metropolis.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Bundy and coke&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Relatively cheap and toxic drink made from coke and Bundaberg rum,
and the cause of at least one embarrassing alcoholic moment for
nearly everyone who has grown up in Queensland. Australians
travelling overseas are stunned by the fact that Bundaberg rum is
marketed globally, just like a name brand that people might
deliberately seek out. Given that it tastes like a low quality
diesel fraction, this is deeply mysterious.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;bush pig&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Someone ugly. While bush pigs are certainly not attractive, why they
get singled out for this backhanded abuse is unclear.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;cacking&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Not to be confusing with the English meaning, this means roughly &amp;quot;to
laugh so hard as to soil yourself&amp;quot;. As in: &amp;quot;When Tanya backed her
ute into the mailbox, I was cacking myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;casket&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The Golden Casket, Queensland's version of the lottery, and
used colloquially in the same sense: &amp;quot;One day when I win the casket
...&amp;quot; One of those words that you don't notice until leaving the
state and then wondering if a lottery was really marketed like some
pirates chest overflowing with dubloons.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;chemist&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A pharmacist or pharmacy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;cockie&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A cockroach. Also a cockatoo. Also, a New South Wales word for
farmer. Curiously, all are present in large quantities in
Queensland.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;cockroach&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Charmingly, someone from New South Wales. Also known as &amp;quot;Mexicans&amp;quot;
(as in &amp;quot;south of the border&amp;quot;).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;college&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;One of a set of internationally confusing terms. In Queensland,
&amp;quot;school&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;school&amp;quot; as in the first 12 years of basic compulsory
education. However, some of the posher schools (and you don't have
to be very posh to be posh in Queensland) call themselves
&amp;quot;colleges&amp;quot;, while others use the term &amp;quot;secondary college&amp;quot; to
differentiate years 8 to 12. After school, one can on to tertiary
education at a university, or a &amp;quot;college&amp;quot;, which is usually a small
university campus or institute that does vocational training (what
one might call a &amp;quot;polytechnic&amp;quot; in the UK). Also used to describe the
residential halls at major universities. So you can go to college at
a college and when you finish, you move on to college where you stay
at a college.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;crash&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;To collapse from exhaustion. Often used as a sign of just how hard
you were partying last night.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;CWA&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Country Womens Association. Loosely like a paleo-conservative and
rural version of the YWCA, this is where all the country girls go to
stay initially when they move down to the &lt;em&gt;big smoke&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;dag&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Somewhat like &amp;quot;nerd&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;geek&amp;quot;, but more a comment about a lack of
sophistication which makes it closer to &amp;quot;yokel&amp;quot;. Of course, making
this accusation in Queensland is absurd at the best of times ...&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;digger&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;As in &amp;quot;old digger&amp;quot;. Strictly speaking, this only applies to
Australian veterans of WWI, but can be used generically to describe
any old &lt;em&gt;bloke&lt;/em&gt;, especially a curmudgeon that glares at you when you
enter &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; pub and later assails you endlessly with stories of how
he saved you from the Hun at El Alamein.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;doona&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A duvet, comforter or quilted eiderdown used as a bed covering.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;deep north&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An allusion to the American &amp;quot;deep south&amp;quot;, used by non-Queenslanders
to refer to (supposedly) fundamentalist, racist, Bible-bashing,
inbred Queensland. Curiously, it's since been used by those in
southern Queensland to refer to far north Queensland, with somewhat
more justification.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;durrie&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A cigarette, particularly a hand-rolled one.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;footy&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sibilant duo-syllable for &amp;quot;football&amp;quot;, thus shortening a word with
two syllables to one with two syllables ...&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;fossick&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;To rummage around or search for something. While this is usually
applied in the domestic context, it can be used for hunting for gems
or mineral deposits.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;furphy&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A lie or tall story.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Gabba&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The Queensland Cricket Ground at Woolloongabba. During summers it
becomes the most highly televised and observed place in the state.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;gone troppo&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Gone mad (because of the heat) or moved to a hot place (where they
will go mad because of the heat).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;go walkabout&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A strangely cliched but genuine bit of slang, meaning &amp;quot;to get lost&amp;quot;
or &amp;quot;or wander off&amp;quot;. So your car keys could &amp;quot;go walkabout&amp;quot; and when
someone fails to show up for a meeting, they're &amp;quot;gone walkabout&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hole in the wall&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A cash machine or automated teller. I could make some comment about
how this reflects a cargo-cult mentality towards banks and money.
But I won't.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hols&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Holidays.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hotel&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A pub, as in a place where you would drink. Also sometimes actually
means &amp;quot;hotel&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hit the turps&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;To go on a drinking binge. Of course, &amp;quot;turps&amp;quot; (via &amp;quot;turpentine&amp;quot;)
means &amp;quot;alcohol&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;huge&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A vague but enthusiastic positive comment, much like &amp;quot;excellent&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;massive&amp;quot;. As in: &amp;quot;How was the party?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Mate, it was huge.&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;humougous&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A similar meaning to &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes, it even means &amp;quot;big&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hunt&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Possibly archaic, but used as an exclamation of how great something
is. As in: &amp;quot;I brought two slabs of beer&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Hunt!&amp;quot;. The antonym is
&amp;quot;unhunt&amp;quot;. I was told this word derives from &amp;quot;hunt out a bargain&amp;quot;,
which seems just as likely as any other possibility.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;krull&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Possibly archaic or of restricted usage, for a while in the early
90s this meant &amp;quot;to destroy utterly&amp;quot;. Probably derived from a very
forgettable movie.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;lamington&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A small square of sponge cake covered in chocolate and desiccated
coconut. A true Queensland icon, as schools often raise money by
having &amp;quot;lamington drives&amp;quot; in which parents make large amounts of
lamingtons for school-children to hawk door-to-door. That the
education of the next generation in &amp;quot;The Smart State&amp;quot; depends in a
large part on these sales of sponge cake is an irony that has
apparently missed the populace.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;mate&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Variously, &amp;quot;you there&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;companion&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;Hey mate&amp;quot;
&lt;em&gt;Excuse me, may I have your attention?&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;Thanks mate&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Thank you,
my friend&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;Well, you and your mates can just piss off&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Your
entourage is no longer welcome in this establishment&lt;/em&gt;, and &amp;quot;Who's
his mate?&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;What is the identity of the person standing next to
him?&lt;/em&gt;. Note that &lt;em&gt;mate&lt;/em&gt; is a gender neutral term.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;mozzie&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Mosquito. That damn &lt;em&gt;sibilant duo-syllable&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;milkbar&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What might be called a &amp;quot;deli&amp;quot; in New York or a &amp;quot;cornershop&amp;quot; in
London, a small local store that contains one copy of every object
in the known world that you only buy for an inflated price because
it's just too far to the supermarket.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;moggy&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A cat, especially a plain-old, domestic, no-particular-breed-at-all
cat. I can't believe you didn't know that.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;no drama&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&amp;quot;No problem&amp;quot;. Also used as &amp;quot;no worries&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;zero sweat&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Paki&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Some one from Pakistan. Oddly enough, in England this is an
incredibly loaded racial epithet, but in Australia it's just a way
of describing nationality, modified into a sibilant duo-syllable -
just like &amp;quot;Kiwi&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pommie&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yankee&amp;quot; and &lt;em&gt;Windies&lt;/em&gt; - and has no
negative connotations at all. In summer the ads for the cricket cry
out &amp;quot;The Pakis are coming!&amp;quot;, which must cause English migrants to
have a fit. Also see &lt;em&gt;Asian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;packing it&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Roughly analogous to &amp;quot;shaking in their boots&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;trembling with
fear&amp;quot;, but used for comic or dramatic effect. &amp;quot;Mate, when Davo saw
the the cops in his rear vision mirror, we were just packin' it.&amp;quot;
Also used as &amp;quot;packing&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;packing her/himself&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;pike&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;To make a flimsy excuse to get out of something. &amp;quot;Did Gazza show up
to the party?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Nah, he piked. Said he had to drive the girlfriend
to work.&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;pissed&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Can be used in the American (&amp;quot;angry&amp;quot;), English (&amp;quot;drunk&amp;quot;), anatomical
(&amp;quot;urinated&amp;quot;), meteorological (&amp;quot;rained a lot&amp;quot;) or movement (&amp;quot;ran
away&amp;quot;) sense. As in: &amp;quot;Davo was so pissed that it was pissing down,
he got pissed and pissed himself so we pissed off.&amp;quot; As is often the
case in Australian speech, context is everything.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;port&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Bag, suitcase or satchel, especially one used for school. Probably
derived from the English word &amp;quot;portmanteau&amp;quot;. Endlessly confusing to
the rest of the Australia, where for many years &amp;quot;port&amp;quot; referred to a
popular style of fortified red wine, originally from Portugal.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Queenslander&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What people from Queensland call themselves, but also a local style
of house. It is built on stumps (and thus raised off the ground)
with wide verandas and a tin roof, and is gloriously suited to the
local climate.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;x's right&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;From experience, this is the construct that causes the greatest
amount of confusion in non-Queenslanders. It occurs variously as
&amp;quot;It's right&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;You're right&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;She's right&amp;quot; (but never &amp;quot;He's right&amp;quot;)
and means in answer to an offer of assistance  &lt;em&gt;It's fine / don't
worry / don't bother / it's oka&lt;/em&gt; y.Note how it conveniently
reduces a lengthy two word phrase to a terse two word phrase.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;rego&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Car registration or tax disk . Because &amp;quot;registration&amp;quot; has, like,
four syllables in it ...&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;rellies&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Relatives. As in: &amp;quot;I have to go and visit the rellies.&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;rooted&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Irrevocably broken. As in: &amp;quot;Your hard disk is rooted mate. Need to
get a new one.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Root&amp;quot; also means &amp;quot;to have sex&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;scallop&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A battered potato cake (&amp;quot;potato scallop&amp;quot;) such as you'd buy in a
fish and chip shop. Also - confusingly - the battered fish
(&lt;em&gt;Patinopecten sp.&lt;/em&gt;), also as you'd buy in a fish and chip shop.
Queenslanders use the same word to refer to both, instinctively
recognising from context which meaning is the intended one. For
example: &amp;quot;I'd like 4 dollars worth of chips and a couple of
scallops.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;OK. Anything else?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ah ... throw in a few scallops as
well.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Coming right up.&amp;quot; This turns out to be a similar usage form
the North of England.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Schoolies&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The &amp;quot;Schoolies' Week&amp;quot;, an end-of-year week-long party held down the
Gold Coast by those graduating from school. Also attracts a large
number of predatory or infantalised university students.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;scratchie&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A scratchcard, with slivery panels that you rub off, such as used in
the lottery or on public transport.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;slab&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A measurement of amount of beer, specifically 24 &lt;em&gt;tinnies&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;stubbies&lt;/em&gt; on a cardboard pallete. If it's a box of large bottles of
beer, it's called a &amp;quot;carton&amp;quot;. This is what people bring to parties.
Reputedly, some &lt;em&gt;truckies&lt;/em&gt; measure the length of their trips in
slabs or cartons. If you're driving on Queensland roads, this is
probably something you didn't want to know.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;spewing&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Expressing comical disappointment or regret. &amp;quot;Mate, when I found out
that Lorraine had actually wanted to go out with me, I was spewing.&amp;quot;
Also used in the sense &amp;quot;to vomit&amp;quot;. Go figure.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;spruik&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A word I used for years before finding no one else knew what it was.
To spruik is to promote, advertise, proselytise, argue for but with
the faint connotation of the carnival barker than of an honest
argument. Can also be used as a noun to describe the product or
output of said spruiking.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;skeg&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A surfie.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;station&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;One of the immense farming properties you'll find in the outback.
Sometimes just called a &amp;quot;property&amp;quot;, never a &amp;quot;ranch&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;farm&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;squizz&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A quick look, an assessment, a once over. Used as both noun and
verb. &amp;quot;Let me have a squizz at that.&amp;quot; Interestingly this appears to
be an old bit of English slang, derived from &amp;quot;inquire&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;inquisitive&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;semi&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Semi-trailer or articulated lorry to you Poms. This is what
Queenslanders mean by truck.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;stubby&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A small bottle (about 500ml) of beer. See &lt;em&gt;tinny&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;Stubbies&amp;quot; are
also a popular brand of shorts.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;sunnies&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sunglasses.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;suss&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Derived generally from &amp;quot;suspicious&amp;quot; but again, used as an adjective
and a verb, with two different meanings. &amp;quot;Seems a bit suss&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(this
item is anomalous, nay untrustworthy&lt;/em&gt;) or &amp;quot;I sussed out a good deal&amp;quot;
(&lt;em&gt;using my raw cunning, I was able to derive a solution&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;ta&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Thank you.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;thongs&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Rubber sandals, what someone from the UK might call &amp;quot;flip-flops&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;jandals&amp;quot; in New Zealand. Essential for the beach, everyone owns a
pair of these.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;this arvo&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Pronounced as one word &lt;em&gt;thiSARvo&lt;/em&gt;. This afternoon.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;tinny&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A tin (can) or beer. See &lt;em&gt;stubby&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;togs&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Bathers or swimsuit. Sydney-siders say &amp;quot;cossie&amp;quot;, which is anathema
to Queenslanders.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;truckie&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A truck driver, but when I say truck, I mean &lt;em&gt;semi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;u-ee&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A U-turn in a car. &amp;quot;So I did a u-ee ...&amp;quot;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;ugg boats&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Uggies, thick sheepskin boots that are universally loved by
&lt;em&gt;bevans&lt;/em&gt;, inexplicably so, given Queensland's tropical climate.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;ute&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Small utility truck.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;whinging Pom&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The archetype of the English in Australia, who seem to spend their
whole time complaining about the weather, delays in public transport
and poor service in restaurants. Like many stereotypes there is a
small vein of truth, although in their defence, I can attest to the
presence in London of thousands of &amp;quot;whinging Aussies&amp;quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Windies&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Someone from the West Indies, and almost always someone from their
crickte team.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;wog&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Someone of Greek or Italian extraction, and sometimes anywhere
non-Anglosaxon as long as you have a swarthy complexion. One of
those complicated words that used to be derogatory (as it still is
in England) but was later reclaimed by young Greek- and
Italian-Australians, and has so become almost respectable. Almost.
Wogs can call each other wogs but don't &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; try to. Has an implied
image of brashness, loudness, trashy pop-culture, big hair and
muscle cars.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;wowser&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A prude or conservative, stereotypically reactionary, anti-alcohol,
anti-sex and luddite. According to the rest of Australia, Queensland
is full of them. This fails to explain the brisk tourist trade.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;XXXX&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The chosen beer of the sunshine state, a golden ambrosia compared to
the filthy slop that passes for &lt;em&gt;beer&lt;/em&gt; in other states.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;yum cha&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Confusing this one. A near universal word used to describe the meals
bought from trolleys in Chinese restaurants. From observation, this
isn't what the Chinese call it, and elsewhere it's called &amp;quot;dim sum&amp;quot;.
Further data points are welcome.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] For non-Australians who doubt me: quickly name as many of the states
and/or capitals of Australia as you can. See what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn't wait for that smarmy little brunette to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the near future, shortly after the Californian invasion of Buenos
Aires which looks like a live action version of &amp;quot;The Jetsons&amp;quot; done by
the cast of &amp;quot;90210&amp;quot;. (Albeit with considerably less animation.) Here our
pearly-teethed teens are beset with those eternal problems of the
spirit: Who will win the big football game? Who shall I go to the prom
with? Shall I join the military, dress up as a Nazi and lay waste to the
known universe? Since Michael &amp;quot;Bad SF is my middle name&amp;quot; Ironside is
playing their mono-handed Civics teacher (with his amputated stump
sticking out a curious extra 15 cm from his shoulder), we can safely
arrive at two conclusions: (1) We are in Bad Movie heaven, (2) Universe,
bend over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, uber-Aryan Johnny Rico (played by that famous Argentinean
actor Casper Van Dien) ends up in the grunts and is sent across to the
next sound stage for routine bastardisation in Movie Cliche #253 (Boot
Camp). His friends show considerably more sense and join the technical
branches. Johnny's lust-thang Carmen (played by the noted Hispanic
thespian Denise Richards) becomes a pilot, where she grins like a
prom-queen on Prozac as she hurls around million-ton starships. Since
their buddy Carl (that noted Latin artiste Neil Patrick Harris, a.k.a.
Doogie Howser) can tell his ferret to crawl up his mother's leg, he
naturally gets put in charge of grand strategy. Only Dizzy (the
up-and-coming Spanish performer Dina Meyer, known for her subtle,
tear-jerking performance alongside Keanu Reeves in &amp;quot;Johnny Catatonic&amp;quot;)
also joins the infantry. You see, Johnny is her lust-thang and she
realises that as soon as she sleeps with him, she can be killed off and
leave the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passes, although all too slowly for the audience. Carmen realises
Johnny has the IQ of toast and sends him a &amp;quot;Dear Johnny&amp;quot; letter. Dizzy,
in an attempt to precipitate her own demise, shows her breasts. In a
training exercise, Johnny accidentally gets a fellow marine killed. The
other recruits - willing to have their limbs broken, trachea crushed and
be stabbed and shot at by their drill instructor - find Johnny's
clumsiness unacceptable and start dropping out of the program. (Or maybe
it was his acting they find unacceptable.) But before Johnny can follow
suite, the dreaded alien bugs fart an asteroid across the galaxy and
squish Buenos Aires. Although Johnny's parents look relieved just before
they are crushed, everyone else knows it's time to kick some arthropod
butt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny and his grunts are choppered out to the Bug homeworld, where the
starships are threatened by bugs belching nuclear plasma into orbit. (I
swear, I am not making this up.) But Carmen's serotonin levels are still
wildly over par and, grinning like the widow of a recently dead rock
star, she hauls her ship out of the way. Johnny and Co are meanwhile
demonstrating the dazzling power of future military tactics: dump a
bunch of guys armed with M16s on a planet and get them to wander around
in a tight pack until they are eaten and thus show how the monster
works. Sure 'nuff, the bugs show up and have far more charisma than the
rest of the cast. Demoralised, the marines retreat, leaving their less
likeable colleagues to be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="digression-1-the-starship-troopers-drinking-game"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digression 1: The Starship Troopers Drinking Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sip whenever a limb is cut off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quaff every time someone is cut in half.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sip whenever Diz lusts after Johnny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quaff any time that smarmy little brunette smiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scull any time someone makes an heroic sacrifice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors are transferred to another unit, the 5th Generic Tough
Hombres. Quelle surprise - it's lead by Michael Ironside, still serving
time in purgatory for &amp;quot;Highlander 2&amp;quot;. It seems they're getting sent to
the poetically named &amp;quot;Planet P&amp;quot; to further the plot. But upon getting
there, they are attacked by - giant mosquitoes! (No, it's too terrible!)
Ironside makes Johnny promise to kill him should he ever be crippled.
Unfortunately Johnny doesn't reply, &amp;quot;If it comes to that, I'll do both
of us.&amp;quot; The grunts come across a devastated firebase and a cowardly
general. He tells them that the bugs are sucking people's brains out
(too late!) and then gets eaten. Ironside has his legs chewed off by a
bug and gets Johnny to kill him - not because he is crippled but because
he is trapped in a crap film. Unfortunately Johnny doesn't cap the rest
of the cast for equally debilitating mental injuries. Subsequently,
Dizzy gets chomped by a bug, because we got to see her breasts earlier
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the starship, they load Dizzy into a coffin and eject her into
space so she can land on the Genesis planet and come back in the sequel
&amp;quot;Starship Troopers 2: The Search for Plot&amp;quot;. Carmen struggles not to
smile during the funeral, Dizzy's convenient death clearing the way for
her and Johnny's lust-thang. Then Doogie shows up, in full Gestapo
regalia. It now becomes clear why everyone looks like Nazis: the war is
being run by geeks and geeky kids think that Nazi stuff is really cool.
Doogie explains he knew Johnny's team would be massacred, it was all
part of the plan. Johnny has no strong objections to this, illustrating
a good reason why he is in the infantry and Doogie in command. Anyway,
the Doog-ster explains that since the bugs can launch asteroids from
halfway across the galaxy and have them land right on top of cities,
they must be intelligent. (Duh.) So it's back to Planet P to catch a
&amp;quot;brainbug&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="digression-2-southpark-troopers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digression 2: Southpark Troopers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't this movie be all the more plausible if it was cheap animation
and used the &amp;quot;Southpark&amp;quot; characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAN: Dude! You're got a bug sucking your brains out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CARTMAN: I hate dat, da way dose bugs crawl up yo' arse and suck your
brains out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENNY: Mi fnk ht d bgsar minhellgen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KYLE: Good point Kenny, there's probably a form of bug we haven't seen
yet, a brainbug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUG: Arrrhhhhh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAN: Oh my god! They've killed Kenny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back they go to the disused quarries of Planet P. But Carmen and the
faux competitor for her affections, Zander (hitherto known as
&amp;quot;Deadmeat&amp;quot;), crash on the planet in the middle of the attack. They are
captured by the bugs and before Carmen can explain her &amp;quot;don't worry, be
happy&amp;quot; philosophy to the insects, they suck Zander's brain. Johnny gives
a stirring speech that they can't just go and rescue her, because the
attack is too important. He then goes and rescues her. Meanwhile the
other troops have caught the brainbug. And who better to mindmeld with a
giant slug than Doogie Howser! He does the Spock thang and announces
that the brainbug is afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So am I Doogie, so am I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="digression-3-five-military-sf-books-that-would-make-better-films"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digression 3: Five Military SF Books That Would Make Better Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Forever War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Forever War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Forever War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Forever War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any Lensman book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humour mode off. There will undoubtedly be those who will defend
&amp;quot;Starship Troopers&amp;quot; by saying that it is a comedy. Certainly there are
moments that are intended to be funny, but it is no more a comedy than
&amp;quot;Total Recall&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Robocop&amp;quot;. Similarly, some may say that the future
depicted is meant to be dystopian and terrible. The lie is put to this
by again invoking Verhoeven's other two SF films. Both of them depicted
unpleasant regimes, even ones with which the characters cooperated with
and supported. But the heroes never liked their worlds, or showed it as
a viable or desirable one. If Verhoeven is attempting to be satirical,
he fails utterly and my suspicion is that he is attempting to have it
both ways, to both laugh at and cheer the fascist,
testosterone-poisoned, gungho histrionics. The situation is not helped
by a wooden cast that can only aspire to being B-grade, dialogue that
gives the word &amp;quot;cliche&amp;quot; a bad name, and a plot that could be second
guessed by undiscovered tribes in the Phillipine jungles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Starship Troopers&amp;quot; is possibly the worst SF movie ever made (0/bomb), a
leprous turd of a film that's so horribly demented that it immediately
is assumed into the pantheon of Truly Bad Movies, with a crassness score
of 4 Lamberts. In fact it is so terrible that you should rush out and
see it now because you will not believe how bad it is. Tuberculosis on
the Sid and Nancy scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Starship Troopers&amp;quot;. Released 1997. Director Paul Verhoeven. Starring
Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake Busey, Neil Patrick
Harris, Clancy Brown, Patrick Muldoon, Michael Ironside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
