      <p>There is a type of thinking extant in many online communities and popular culture. It's a versatile tool for speculation and mystery-solving, it lends itself to intractable problems in many fields. It's easy to use, it's powerful and it's utterly wrong. It's <em>anti-explanations</em>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/">subreddit</a> devoted to the radio show <a class="reference external" href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> is awash with this sort of thinking. (For those who were living under a rock in early 2015, the show concerned itself with the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Hae_Min_Lee">1999 murder of a Baltimore highschool student</a> and the subsequent conviction of her ex-boyfriend on arguably thin evidence. <a class="citation-reference" href="#serial" id="id1">[serial]</a>) <em>I've got it</em> a poster will proclaim. <em>She stumbled upon a drug deal and was killed.</em></p>
<p>Yes, that could explain it.</p>
<p>But why would you want to explain it that way?</p>
<p>In a strange way, the absence of evidence becomes the evidence of absence. A young student disappears in crime-ridden Baltimore? Clearly, it's a serial killer or drug gang. Someone with no history of violence is convicted of murder? Because they &quot;snapped&quot;. After 15 years, a convict still maintains his innocence? Because he's a cunning sociopath. Sure, there's no evidence he's guilty. But is there any evidence he's innocent?</p>
<p>Thus a killer can appear and disappear. A non-violent person can be violent <a class="citation-reference" href="#violence" id="id2">[violence]</a>. The behaviour of an innocent man is the same as that of a guilty man.</p>
<p>I call these anti-explanations, but in a sense they are <em>anti-theories</em>, theories based on a lack of evidence that explain everything including the lack of evidence. The world governments are aware of the existence of UFOs but keep it secret. You can tell, because they won't own up to it. An white child disappears. It's an organised pedophile gang, obviously, because there's no other reason a child would disappear <a class="citation-reference" href="#child" id="id3">[child]</a>. That celebrity numbs themselves with drink and drugs, because they are tormented and angst-ridden. I know they're tormented and angst-ridden, just look at how they drink and take drugs.</p>
<p>Understand that I am not arguing against any idea that is improbable or atypical or extraordinary. I'm arguing against theories that are unsupported and somehow manage to explain away their lack of support or even sell it as proof. Anti-explanations can be found in conventional and alternative thought, sceptical and fortean communities, in politics and economics.</p>
<p>In fact, these are not even theories, they're stories, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_So_Stories">&quot;just so&quot; stories</a>. The leopard got its spots from being painted. The kangaroo learnt to jump after being chased. That suspect looks innocent because they're acting innocent.</p>
<p>My idea is not without precedent. Charles Fort famously observed of modern science that &quot;One starts measuring a circle from anywhere.&quot; Robert Anton Wilson once spoke of &quot;strange loops&quot;, conspiracies that were so vast, so over-arching, that anything we know could be disinformation planted by the conspiracy - <em>including evidence of the conspiracy itself</em>. Jeff Ritzmann used the companion phrase &quot;anti-evidence&quot; when <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paranormalwaypoint.com/727/">talking about the latest &quot;revelation&quot; about aliens landing at Roswell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
It’s proof of everything, and nothing. It’s something that solicits a lot of words but doesn’t actually say anything. It tantalizes with words like ‘evidence’, ‘provenance’ and ‘lineage’ – but the foundation of the initial contention is built upon thin, vapid air.</blockquote>
<p>Anti-explanations have several important qualities that desrive their appeal:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>They promise to explain an intractable mystery completely</li>
<li>They fit the evidence by fitting none of the evidence, by invoking groups and motivations from outside as causes and explanations.</li>
<li>The absence of evidence is used as evidence of the perpetrators skill and power</li>
<li>The details are vague and malleable, leaning on broad cliches and stereotypes</li>
<li>As a consequence, anti-explanations are largely unprovable, untestable and unrefutable. Should evidence crop up that contradicts it, an anti-explanation can often mutate to fit around it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In turn:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Complete solutions:</dt>
<dd>Many famous mysteries are such because they are essentially unresolvable. We're unlikely to ever figure out what happened to Benjamin Bathurst, the only people who know what happend aboard the Marie Celeste likely died in the event,</dd>
<dt>Vague details and broad cliches:</dt>
<dd>There's something almost Victorian about the agents invoked in anti-explanations. Sex slavers. Pedophile gangs. Psychopaths. Drug dealers. Serial killers <a class="citation-reference" href="#serial-killer-numbers" id="id4">[serial_killer_numbers]</a>. They're one with the bands of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_social_workers">phantom social workers</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse">satanic abuse cults</a> that were once reported to prowl England, trying to kidnap children. These groups serve to both expose and paper over a potential problem for anti-explanations: motivation. Why would anyone what to kidnap this child? They're a pedophile gang <a class="citation-reference" href="#pedogang" id="id5">[pedogang]</a>. Why did this person disappear? They blundered into a drug deal. Who committed this murder? A psychopath. The 'why' is neatly avoided by replacing it with a 'who' that doesn't need an explanation. A pschopath needs no motivation, because they are &quot;mad&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lighter versions of this method abound. Venture into any true crime or armchair detective forum  <a class="citation-reference" href="#ws" id="id6">[ws]</a> and you'll see posters speaking of their favoured suspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;There's something off about him&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;In my gut, I know it&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I have a feeling there's an arrest in the forthcoming future&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>and profer vague &quot;theories&quot; of a crime:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;I believe someone followed them&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It was a family member, I'm sure&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The kidnapping was planned by important/powerful people&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>As if distant impressions were evidence. As &quot;someone&quot; was a lead. As if these was anything that could refuted or proven.</p>
<p>panics</p>
<p>fear of the uncontrollable</p>
