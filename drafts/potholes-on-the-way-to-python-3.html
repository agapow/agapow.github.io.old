      <div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Python 3 has been around for (oh so) many years, with the general attitude of the community being &quot;eh, I'll get around to it some day&quot;. While it has some nice syntactic features and cleans up a few dusty corners in the language, none are must-haves and many have been ported back to Python 2. Coupled with the fact that many critical libraries hadn't been ported to Python 3 (and you only need one non-ported library in your toolkit for it to be a roadblock), there's not been any great reason to make the leap.</p>
<p>But it seems as if the tipping point may finally been reached, with &quot;Python 3 only&quot; starting to appear slowly across the software landscape. Late last year I decided to make the leap and start writing everything in Python 3, being assuaged by vague comments commonly thrown around in developer circles:</p>
<blockquote>
Most / many Python 2 scripts will run in Python 3 without any problems / with just a few small fixes.</blockquote>
<p>This is not actually true.</p>
<p>In fact, a non-trivial Python 2 script is unlikely to work unaltered in Python 3. Certainly some problems can be readily fixed, but correcting others will be tedious (e.g. renamed modules) and yet others may require some recoding.</p>
<p>While a single person or outfit might personally commit to Python 3, once their code goes out to anyone else, there's a large need for it to still run under Python 2. (Not everyone has made the leap, some have large bodies of legacy code that is Python 2 only, 'stable' server environments may fix on a version of Python 2 for stability, etc.) Like it or not, we have have to work across the divide.</p>
<p>A hardline solution to this dual environment is to develop Python 2 and 3 versions of a single library as two different libraries. While there may be good technical reasons for this, the extra development effort is just a non-starter for people like me, for whom code is simply a means-to-an-end. Looking at Python code repositories, I suspect most others feel the same:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;There is no sane business reason to spend 100s of thousands of dollars or  millions of dollars worth of engineering time to port to Python 3. You might as well ask someone to port their entire codebase to Ruby.&quot; [Python 3 is killing Python]</blockquote>
<p>So, like many others, I've committed to writing code that works in Python 2 <em>and</em> Python 3. The below is a set of notes about problems encountered and possible solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-strategies">
<h2>General strategies</h2>
<div class="section" id="target-python-2-7">
<h3>Target Python 2.7</h3>
<p>As said, a lot of the Python 3 changes have been back-ported, largely appearring in Python 2.7. There will be isolated cases where people will be stuck with earlier Python 2.x versions. You could target 2.6 with some difficulty but anything earlier is a non-starter. Targeting 2.7 will do for the lions share.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-six-or-futurize">
<h3>Use six or futurize</h3>
<p>Several helper libraries and tools have been written to help produce hybrid Python 2/3 code. Note that I said &quot;help&quot; - there's nothing that will faultlessly port your code, and I've encountered cases where the results were highly dysfunctional. Proceed with caution ...</p>
<p>The most prominent is <strong>six</strong>. It provides a compatibility layer that can be called by Python 2 and 3, smoothing over the differences in types, renamed modules, iteration methods and much more. It's fairly easy to use, albeit occasionally in your face (e.g having to use special iterators for dictionaries), and supports Python all the way back to v2.4. Of course, it brings in a dependency on another module but that's the price you pay.</p>
<p><strong>Future</strong> is a counterpart for <em>six</em>, that tends to be higher-level and lean more on backported features. As a result the code is bit cleaner and simpler, although it only supports as far back as Python 2.6. <em>Future</em> can not only make Python 2 code compatible with 3 but Python 3 code compatible with 2.</p>
<p>There's a seperate effort called <strong>modernise</strong> that provides similar conversion facilities, but using <em>six</em>.</p>
<p>I'd suggest using either <em>six</em> or <em>future</em> (but not both), with a slight inclination towards future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-2to3-with-caution">
<h3>Use 2to3 with caution</h3>
<p>The <strong>2to3</strong> tool converts Python 2 code to Python 3 and so you can use it to do a bulk conversion of a codebase. But, while the <em>2to3</em> tool is devilishly clever, it's a one way trip and not infallible: I've encountered several examples where it fails and you have to make changes manually. Rather than use it to make a dual codebase, it may be useful to convert code and then work on it to make it Python 2.7 compatible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specific-issues">
<h2>Specific issues</h2>
<p>The specific differences between Python 2 and 3 fall into two categories:</p>
<p># Those that have been back-ported to Python 2, or can otherwise be accommodated by small adjustments in programming style or idiom. Most of the differences fall into this group.</p>
<p># Those that are basic changes in the way things work between versions of Python. There are a few of these and they require fundamental changes to your code.</p>
<div class="section" id="exceptions">
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Exceptions have changed in small but irritating ways that can be solved by targeting the backports to 2.7:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">exceptions</tt> modules has disappeared with all the exceptions existing in the globals space.</li>
<li>Instead of creating an exception with <cite>raise IOError, &quot;file error&quot;</cite>, you now must use the (more OOP) way <cite>raise IOError (&quot;file error&quot;)</cite>.</li>
<li>Likewise, exceptions catching has changed from <cite>except FooError, e</cite> to <cite>except FooError as e</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
try:
    let_us_cause_an_error()
except FooError as e:
    print (e, 'caught a FooError')
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strings">
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>There's actually few surprises in the Python 3 strings. They're unicode by default so handling exotic text is actually easier. While the <cite>%</cite> formatting syntax has been deprecated in favour of <cite>format()</cite>, it still works and so can be left in there.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">print foo</tt> had of course been replaced with <tt class="docutils literal">print (foo)</tt> but function has been backported to Py2 and so you can use it in legacy code.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">basestring</tt> has disappeared to be replaced with just <tt class="docutils literal">str</tt></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="numerics">
<h3>Numerics</h3>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">long</tt> type has disappeared with <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> expanding to take up the space.</p>
<p>Integer division no longer truncates (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">5 / 2 =&gt; 2.5</tt>), but you shouldn't have been relying on implicit truncation anyway.</p>
<p>from __future__ import division</p>
<p>or use float</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dictionaries">
<h2>Dictionaries</h2>
<p>has_hey has disappeared
itervalues and iteritems are now just values and items</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="iteration">
<h2>Iteration</h2>
<p>xrange gone, range is a lazy container</p>
<p>Good news is: In Python 3.x for-loop variables don't leak into the global namespace anymore!</p>
<p>from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function
from __future__ import unicode_literals</p>
</div>
